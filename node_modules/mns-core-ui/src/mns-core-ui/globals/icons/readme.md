#Icons

## Usage

To use an icon you have to add the icon class to an HTML tag, for example:

```
<span class="mns-core__icon-bag"></span>.
```

## Updating Icon Fonts

1. Go to https://icomoon.io/app

2. Click on Import Icons to import 'src/mns-core-ui/icons/mns-core-icons/selection.json'

3. Click on Generate Font

4. Click on Download

5. Add the downloaded fonts under mns-core-ui > globals > icons

6. Delete the example, readme files, keep the folder structure same as mns-core-icons

7. Copy the selection.json to data/ folder and rename to mock.json


**IMPORTANT**
If the icon code is regenerated with icon moon the \_styles.scss file must have the styles applied to:

```
[class^='mns-core__icon-'],
[class*=' mns-core__icon-'] {
```

altered so they are applied to the before pseudo class, i.e

```
[class^='mns-core__icon-'],
[class*=' mns-core__icon-']
&:before {
```

# Sprites

Sprites are generated with every build and saved to the dist folder.

##Usage

To use a sprite you have to add the sprite class to an HTML tag, for example:

<span class="mns-core__icon-cards--msdebitcard"></span>.
```

- mns-core__icon: prefix configured in sprity-webpack-plugin
- cards: sprite folder full of .pngs
