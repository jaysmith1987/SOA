Colours

These are the main swatch palettes used across M&S.com. Grey's are to be used primarily for text, line dividers and borders. Primary colours are to be used for brand purposes and highlights (e.g. sales & special offers). Function colours are to only be used to provide feedback to the user.

During development SASS variable names should be used, each of the following colours start with $color__brand followed by the colour as detailed below. For example, $color__brand--green.

Grey palette

Always use either #000000 or #333333 for text - all other greys will fail accessibility tests. #cccccc is commonly used for borders or 1px line dividers.
