#Buttons

in your application SASS `@import 'mns-core-ui/components/buttons';`

To style a button you need to add several classes to the element you are using as a button, the '.btn' and the class identifying the button type.  There are a number of button types, all of which can be viewed in the [pattern library](http://patternlibrary.mnsdigital.io/#/Core/Components/Buttons):

`.btn .btn--{type}`

There are 4 button types that are available:

- primary 
- secondary
- tertiary
- quaternary

See buttons/hbs for examples of this.

all of these button types can then have a disabled state added to them by adding a CSS class of `.btn--disabled`

all of the button types can also have an icon class added (see globals/icons)

A complete example would be:

```
<button class="btn btn--primary mns-core__icon-gift">
    Button with gift icon
</button>
```
